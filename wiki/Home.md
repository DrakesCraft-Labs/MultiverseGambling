## The three ideas behind the plugin

1. **The maths live outside Bukkit.** Everything that decides money is plain Java in
   `com.chagui68.multiversegambling.engine`, so it is unit tested in milliseconds and the
   plugin can only use those formulas.
2. **Money can be settled once.** Bets are wrapped in a `Wager` that refuses a second
   payout; group games use a `Pot` that holds one wager per player.
3. **Randomness that decides money is provably fair.** A server secret plus your own seed
   produce every roll, and `/mvgam verify` lets anybody recompute them.

## Quick tour

```
/mvgam                      → main menu (solo / group tabs)
/mvgam play roulette        → play a game by its exact id
/mvgam play plinko          → then "❖ Bet items" to stake items instead of money
/mvgam world                → travel to the casino world
/mvgam language es          → read everything in Spanish from now on
/mvgam verify               → audit the fairness of every roll
/mvgam world build          → rebuild the plaza, roads and arenas (admin)
/mvgam world info           → what the casino world is missing (admin)
```
